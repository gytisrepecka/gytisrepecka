# Gytis Repečka

My name is **Gytis Repečka**, I am Solution Architect and data professional with over 10 years of experience designing and implementing Data Warehouse solutions based on Teradata, Informatica PowerCenter, Oracle Data Integrator, PostgreSQL on premise and on mainstream cloud vendors (AWS, Azure). Currently focusing on Data Vault automation and APIs.

I am strong open source advocate promoting, documenting, teaching about and contributing to open source software and open hardware projects. Key interests are data architecture, personal privacy and security, databases, backend development, internet of things (IoT), automotive diagnostics and telemetry.

## Notice about GitHub usage

I am using GitHub in limited capacity by choice - only to contribute to open source projects which track issues and maintain code here. Primary repositories and mirrors of my own projects are hosted at [personal instance](https://source.gyt.is/) for privacy and data sovereignty reasons.
